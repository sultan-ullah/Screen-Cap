# Tab Grab
Chrome extension to take a screen capture of the current screen or a portion of the screen

## How It Works

As this extension is not published the only way to use it is to make a zip file and upload it to the browser through the settings.

This is essentially an extension of the screenshot demo by Google found here:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#search:screenshot

When the extension icon is clicked it allows the user to create an area to crop out from the image and save the result, this uses the Image Crop project I created earlier and applies it to a Chrome extension

## Lessons Learned

- Chrome Extension API
- JavaScript more JavaScript callbacks
